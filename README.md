### Title: Business Governance using Data Analytics
#### In this case study, our main focus is to understand the governance of data and its applications in the business domain. For retail businesses to thrive in a data-centric world, it is imperative that they retain control over their data - from how it’s created to who has access to it, to where it's being stored. Over the past few years, retail industries have undergone a massive transformation as customers became digital natives and their buying habits changed. The transformation hasn’t been easy and today, retailers deal with immense amounts of data to analyse consumer trends, manage inventories and predict future demands. In light of this, our main objective through this paper is to show how data mining can help discover relevant knowledge contained in databases obtained from a well-based Superstore. These findings can be used to help business owners of a certain retail firm keep track of how their company is performing and find out the weak areas over which the company can develop in order to make profit. On the whole, as the retail industry will undergo more changes in the future, it is necessary to be prepared to establish a culture of data governance to derive improved business outcomes.
